/*
 *	So, this is my short write up for my java project. 
 *
 *	I have three different classes, composed of one constructor class and a large amount of my methods, and
 * it is under the name of Item. Another class is the Vendable class, which is an interface that holds 
 * several methods as well. Then, I have my largest class, probably able to be called a "mega class" that
 * possesses my objects and interacts with the user. 
 * 
 * I am operating of off the foundation of User Choice through a switch statement. I feel like this was one
 *  of the most effective ways to go about designing a vending machine, and really just an interesting way
 *  to further explore switch statements. 
 *  
 * IF you have any questions regarding my code, or how I came to write it please ask.
